Manage users
#############

The `Keycloak service <https://www.keycloak.org/>`_ is an open-source identity and access management solution that provides authentication, authorization, and single sign-on capabilities for applications and services.

To manage users in Keycloak, perform these steps:

.. note::
   
   Make sure that the port on which Keycloak is running is accessible. 
   If you have changed the default port, replace ``8011`` with the correct port number.

#. Open the Keycloak Admin Console at `<http://keycloak.local.se:8011/auth/>`_.

#. On the Keycloak Admin Console welcome page, click **Administration console**.

#. On the Keycloak **Log in** dialog, log in with Keycloak administrator credentials.

   The Keycloak Admin Console interface opens.

#. In the left pane, select the **ansys-solutions** realm.

   By default, it opens to the **User list** tab, which shows all the registered users for the realm.
