Enable user access to a deployed app
#####################################

.. attention::
  This section is applicable only for solution apps that were created using the **optiSLang 2024 R2 release**. 
  Solution apps created using the **optiSLang 2024 R2 SP2 service pack** can be directly accessed on the Ansys App Portal without any changes in the ``hosts`` file.


Follow these instructions to make and verify the required changes.

Gather required values
=======================

The following values are required to update entries in the ``hosts`` file.

.. list-table::
   :stub-columns: 1
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 10 90

   * - Value
     - Description
   * - ``<vm_ip>``
     - IP address on the VM.
   * - ``<vm_hostname>``
     - Hostname of the VM.
   * - ``<domain_suffix>``
     - Full domain suffix of the VM.
   * - ``<name_of_the_solution>``
     - Name of the solution app deployed to the VM.

.. note::
  These values are known to the IT administrator who deploys Ansys App Portal and Deployment Templates platform on the VM.

.. tip::
    On Windows operating systems, the ``hosts`` file is located at ``C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts``.


Update app entries
====================
Add the following entry using the format shown here:

.. code-block::
  :caption: hosts

  <vm_ip> <name_of_the_solution>.<vm_hostname>.<domain_suffix>


Verify app entries
====================

Once added, the entry should look similar to the app entries shown here:

.. image:: /_static/documenting/local_solution_hosts.png


Verify app access
==================
Once all changes are included in hosts file, to access a portal, in browser type URL: ``portal.<vm_hostname>.<domain_suffix>:8011``.
Once the entries are updated in the ``hosts`` file, the user should be able to access the deployed app as follows:

#. Open the Ansys App Portal in a browser at the following URL:

   .. code-block::

     portal.<vm_hostname>.<domain_suffix>:8011

   .. note::
    In this example, ``8011`` is the default value of a ``<TR_PORT>`` set on the VM where the portal is running. Check with your administrator if different port is used.

#. Log in with portal user credentials.

   The portal opens to its **Home** page in a new browser tab.

#. Click :guilabel:`Explore applications`.

   The **Applications** dashboard opens, showing the apps to which the user has access.

#. Click the card of the app.

   If access is enabled, the app opens to its **Projects** dashboard. The user should be able to add a new project for the app.
