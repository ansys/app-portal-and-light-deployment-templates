Update the hosts file
#####################

In order to make the virtual machine (VM) instance accessible on the virtual network, you need to update and verify the entries in the ``hosts`` file on the VM, both for the platform as a whole and for each solution app deployed to the Ansys App Portal.

Follow these instructions to update and verify the necessary changes to the ``hosts`` file.

      When you first deploy the platform on a VM, update and verify ``hosts`` file entries to make the platform accessible over the virtual network.

      When you deploy a new solution app to the Ansys App Portal on a VM, verify the automatically updated ``hosts`` file entries that make the deployed app accessible over the virtual network.


.. tip::

    On Windows operating systems, the ``hosts`` file is located at ``C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts``.
